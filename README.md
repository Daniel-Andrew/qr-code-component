## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I had a taste of Bootstrap 5 for the first time and learned a lot. It's definetely more efficient to use this framework than to actually code in just CSS.


### Continued development

I would like to become more reliant on Bootstrap and be able to use it flawlessly in the future.
